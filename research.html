    Research in the Kaur Lab focuses on understanding biological
    energy conversion processes using computational biophysics and
    molecular simulations. Our work aims to uncover the molecular
    mechanisms governing photosynthesis, hydration dynamics, and
    protein–environment interactions.

      <h3>Photosynthetic Systems</h3>
      <p>
        We investigate Photosystem I and II using atomistic molecular
        dynamics and quantum mechanical approaches to understand
        energy transfer, charge separation, and pigment–protein
        interactions.

      <h3>Interfacial Water & Hydration</h3>
      <p>
        Our research explores the structure and dynamics of interfacial
        water near biomolecular surfaces and its role in stability,
        function, and energy landscapes.

      <h3>Multiscale Modeling</h3>
      <p>
        We employ multiscale computational techniques combining
        classical MD, QM/MM, and enhanced sampling methods to study
        complex biological systems.
